Portfolio Project Deeper Overview
Some things to think about
Role
Within the team you are on, we encourage you to take on the challenges that will be relevant for you to speak about in your (eventual) job search. For example, if your project is an ride-sharing clone, and you want to be a front end engineer, then it’s important to take on challenges with accessibility, interactive elements and user-interface. Likewise, if you are interested in backend engineering, it will be important to architect the API endpoints, data modeling and performance.

Scope
There is always a risk that your project is too ambitious, or not ambitious enough. Each has its disadvantage. For this project, consider that it is much better to end up with something a bit smaller in scope that has undergone a couple (or at least one) iteration of deployment, testing and bug fixes. Documentation is also a big bonus!

Novelty
Each person and team is unique. We encourage you to bring a sense of individuality to your project, so that you can use it as a tool to speak about other aspects of yourself or your team. As an example, if a team wants to create a buy/sell marketplace app and they are both passionate about bicycling, they may want to focus their marketplace on bicycles exclusively so specific attributes can be defined to track the items.

Note: A professional project theme is a requirement. We recommend avoiding themes focused on religion, political parties and views, sexuality, sexual orientation, or illegal substances. If there is a specific reason you are passionate about a topic and would like to pursue it, please meet with a staff member to discuss. As an example, creating a platform to have open political discourse with a moderation feature would be acceptable. A site to promote all the representatives and voting history of a single political party would not be acceptable.

No idea? we have some for you…
If you don’t know what to build, we have some ideas for you:

Create a web service that uses API (like a GitHub stats of an account, etc.)
Import a rich data set, sanitize it, and create a website to visualize the data with interactive zoom and sliders
Create a music recommender based on a set of ‘liked’ songs
Write a game that can be played against another person or an AI
Ship an Android app
Create an IoT system
Write an image compression algorithm
Write a compiler
Write your own Docker-like container service
Create a “One click” to deploy a cluster of blockchain mining workers with a web page to report on its statistics
Create a “One click” to deploy a cluster of servers hosting docker, with a web page where you can start containers on-demand
Default Project
If you do not have an idea, and do not submit a proposal or do not gain approval for your proposed projects, you’ll be expected to complete the 2D Game: The Maze - concept page available on top of this project.
